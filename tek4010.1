.SH DESCRIPTION
tek4010 version 1.9
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-noexit\fR
do not close window after completion of "command"
.TP
\fB\-raw\fR
do not execute an automatic CR (carriage return) after a
LF (line feed)
.TP
\fB\-tab1\fR
execute a blank instead of a tab to the next 8\-character column
.TP
\fB\-b100000\fR, \fB\-b38400\fR, \fB\-b19200\fR, \fB\-b9600\fR, \fB\-b4800\fR, \fB\-b2400\fR, \fB\-b1200\fR, \fB\-b600\fR, \fB\-b300\fR
Emulate a baud rate. Without one of these arguments, the baud rate
is 19200 baud. The original Tektronix 4010 had a maximal baud rate
of 9600 baud. The 4014 could support up to 100000 baud with a special
interface. With the small baud rates you can emulate 1970s
style modem performance. Early modems had a baud rate of 300.
.TP
\fB\-full\fR
in this mode the tek4010 emulator creates a full screen window and
uses the full resolution of the 4014 with the enhanced graphics
module installed, scaled down to the actual window size.
Use ctrl\-q to close the tek4010 window.
.TP
\fB\-fullv\fR
in this mode the tek4010 emulator creates a decorated window
using the maximal vertical space available. The full resolution of
the 4014 with the enhanced graphics module installed is used,
scaled down to the actual window size
.TP
\fB\-ARDS\fR
display ARDS data
.TP
\fB\-APL\fR
emulate Tektronix 4013/4015 with alternative APL character set.
Details see below.
.TP
\fB\-autoClear\fR
erase screen if a line feed is executed at the bottom of the screen.
This makes it sometimes easier to use tek4010 as the only terminal.
It is not the behaviour of the original hardware.
.TP
\fB\-keepsize\fR
tek4010 sets the fontsize to normal whenever the screen is erased.
This option keeps the currently selected font size until it is
changed with a new escape sequence. Some historic plot files will
not reset the font size back to normal if this option is set.
.TP
\fB\-hidecursor\fR
hides the cursor. Do not set while using GIN mode.
.TP
\fB\-wait\fR n
Close window n seconds after completion of "command".
It does not make sense to use \fB\-noexit\fR together with \fB\-wait\fR.
.TP
\fB\-fast\fR
Use fast rendering without fading. Recommended on slower systems.
This mode can be used to avoid a slow and choppy display.
\fB\-fast\fR is automatically used for baud rates above 19200.
