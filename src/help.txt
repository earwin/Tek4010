Usage: tek4010 [options] COMMAND [...]

    -h, --help      Print this help and exit.

    -noexit         do not close window after completion of "command"

    -raw            do not execute an automatic CR (carriage return) after a
                    LF (line feed)

    -tab1           execute a blank instead of a tab to the next 8-character column

    -b100000, -b38400, -b19200, -b9600, -b4800, -b2400, -b1200, -b600, -b300
                    Emulate a baud rate. Without one of these arguments,
                    the baud rate is 19200 baud. The original Tektronix
                    4010 had a maximal baud rate of 9600 baud. The
                    4014 could support up to 100000 baud with a special
                    interface. With the small baud rates you can emulate
                    1970s style modem performance. Early modems had a
                    baud rate of 300.

    -full           in this mode the tek4010 emulator creates a full screen window and
                    uses the full resolution of the 4014 with the enhanced
                    graphics module installed, scaled down to the actual
                    window size. Use ctrl-q to close the tek4010 window.

    -fullv          in this mode the tek4010 emulator creates a decorated window
                    using the maximal vertical space available. The full
                    resolution of the 4014 with the enhanced graphics
                    module installed is used, scaled down to the actual
                    window size

    -ARDS           display ARDS data

    -APL            emulate Tektronix 4013/4015 with alternative APL character set.
                    Details see below.

    -autoClear      erase screen if a line feed is executed at the bottom of the screen.
                    This makes it sometimes easier to use tek4010 as
                    the only terminal. It is not the behaviour of the
                    original hardware.

    -keepsize       tek4010 sets the fontsize to normal whenever the screen is erased.
                    This option keeps the currently selected font size
                    until it is changed with a new escape sequence. Some
                    historic plot files will not reset the font size
                    back to normal if this option is set.

    -hidecursor     hides the cursor. Do not set while using GIN mode.

    -wait n         Close window n seconds after completion of "command".
                    It does not make sense to use -noexit together with -wait.

    -fast           Use fast rendering without fading. Recommended on slower systems.
                    This mode can be used to avoid a slow and choppy display.
                    -fast is automatically used for baud rates above 19200.
